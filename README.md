üåê WebLoader 1.0.0

WebLoader is a desktop GUI application for downloading and managing mods from Thunderstore ‚Äî specifically for the WebFishing community. Built using Python and Tkinter, WebLoader helps streamline the mod installation process with features like batch downloads, mod presets, real-time console logs, and automatic zip extraction.

Features

 * Thunderstore URL Parsing: Just paste a Thunderstore mod URL and let WebLoader handle the rest.
 * Batch Mod Downloader: Download and extract multiple mods in one click.
 * Preset Support: Save and load your mod lists.
 * Auto Folder Management: Automatically detects and installs mods to appropriate folders.
 * Smart Extraction: Finds innermost folders containing .dll, .pck, or .json files.
 * Modern UI: Dark mode-themed Tkinter interface with styled widgets.
 * Verbose Console Output: See what‚Äôs happening under the hood in real time.
 * Fallback Strategies: Uses API, HTML parsing, and heuristics to find mod download links.

‚ñ∂ Run the App
üñº Usage

  Launch the app.
  Choose your desired mods folder.
  Paste mod URLs from Thunderstore 
  (e.g. https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/Author/ModName/).
  Click Add Mod.
  Click Download Mods.
  Optionally save/load mod presets.

Presets

Presets are saved as JSON files containing lists of mod URLs. You can:

  Save Preset ‚Äî to reuse mod lists across installs.

  Load Preset ‚Äî to quickly rehydrate mod collections.

API + HTML Parsing

  Uses Thunderstore APIs (/api/experimental/package/...) for download URLs.
  Falls back to HTML scraping and common version guessing if APIs fail.

üìÑ Download Summary

After each run, a download_summary.json file is saved in your mods folder. This includes:

  List of downloaded mods
  Success/failure/skipped counts
  Download timestamp

‚Ä¢ GDWeave
‚Ä¢ FishingSeason
‚Ä¢ GrowthHelper

  Known Issues

Thunderstore API downtime may cause fallback to HTML parsing.
Mods with non-standard folder structures might not extract correctly.
GUI responsiveness may lag slightly during heavy extraction (runs in thread but still Tkinter-based).
